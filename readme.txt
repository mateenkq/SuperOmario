The Super Omar.io Project

Our project was simply to recreate the original Super Mario game but in the context of Bucknell University. The story is the Super Omar.io wants to get to his 8 AM lectures and he faces obstacles throughout his way to class. When he reaches the building where his class is, the user wins. If he gets caught by the blue screens of death (the enemies) or falls, he loses. If he drinks 10 coffees he gets an extra life.

Instructions to run the game:

All you have to do is run the .jar file that we have and everything will work as intended.
Simply type "java -jar <the file name>" into the command line.

The java file containing the main java program is in the source package and is called "GameMain.java"
